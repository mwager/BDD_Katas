  ###
  * Second part of the book: LOW LEVEL SPECS
  *   -> Product & StudyBook low level specs
  *   -> Cart low level specs
  *
  *   - They help to find specific bugs (defect localization). -> find bugs
  *   - They are most useful to developers that maintain the code later.
  *   - There are usually a lot of low level specs since they need to
  *     cover all the low level details, special and edge cases.

    * - They are most useful when shown to stakeholders.
    * - There are usually only a few. They don't include all special cases and details.
